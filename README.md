# About Me

I'm a software developer, former teacher, and master crafter with over 12 years of experience in the education field. Ever since I can remember, I have been very organized and orderly, to the point where I have had an inner monologue helping me with my daily tasks, and the quickest way to accomplish them. It is this mindset that makes my brain perfect for the coding world. I naturally organize my thoughts in a way that makes sense, and with my background as a teacher I am also very comfortable working in a team. I understand the importance of being a life long learner, especially when working in the tech field. Computers are ever changing, and it is our job as software developers to learn, and grow with the new syntaxes being pushed. I have a strong passion for problem solving and finding solutions, and I look forward to finding a place where I can put these skills to a good use and help a company grow.

## Tech Elevator

Tech Elevator is a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp learning how to create dynamic web-based software systems using Java providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.

### 2000's Media Colsolidation

Movie/TV Database which implements a Java program back end to pull information from an API and auto sort into SQL Databases, that information is then given to a front end to display.
A project to showcase what I learned at Tech Elevator. The idea came when I noticed my personal collection of DVD's collecting dust in my basement, and finding a solution to minimize the space being taken, while organizing my DVD's in a way that would be easy to refer to when I wanted to actually watch a physical movie. I then created a relational database using SQL, and began hard coding information directly into SQL. After several hours of hard coding, it was painfully obvious why having a back end and API was so important. From here I used Java, JDBC Template, and Postman API's to create an application where I wouldn't need to hard code data in my tables anymore. From here I created a very basic fron end using Vue to display my data.
