# About Me

I'm a software developer, former teacher, and master crafter with over 12 years of experience in the education field. Ever since I can remember, I have been very organized and orderly, to the point where I have had an inner monologue helping me with my daily tasks, and the quickest way to accomplish them. It is this mindset that makes my brain perfect for the coding world. I naturally organize my thoughts in a way that makes sense, and with my background as a teacher I am also very comfortable working in a team. I understand the importance of being a life long learner, especially when working in the tech field. Computers are ever changing, and it is our job as software developers to learn, and grow with the new syntaxes being pushed. I have a strong passion for problem solving and finding solutions, and I look forward to finding a place where I can put these skills to a good use and help a company grow.

Tech Elevator is a 14-week full-stack coding bootcamp learning how to create dynamic web-based software systems using Java providing 800+ hours of development education and application. While there I learned about about a ton including Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Responsive Design, IntelliJ, Git, Unit Testing (JUnit), E/R diagrams, and Integration Testing.
